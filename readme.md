# advent of code
###### solutions by nealxm

the advent of code challenge is a challenge held in december every year that developers from around the world partake in.
since discovering the challenge in august 2024, i have been working on their puzzles as a hobby.
my goal is to evenually complete all the puzzles going back to 2015 when the challenge was created.
i also plan to do each year's puzzles in a different language so as to keep learning new things and recognize patterns across languages.
as per advent of code guidelines i have not uploaded any of my user-specific puzzle input to this repository,
however all solutions can be found separated into folders by year.
